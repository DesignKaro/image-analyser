# SEO & Content Recommendations (Ahrefs Data)

Based on Ahrefs keyword research for **"image to prompt"** (5.4K US, 83K global, Difficulty 33, ~41 referring domains to rank top 10).

---

## 1. Metadata & On-Page (Quick Wins)

### Root layout
- **Current:** "Image Analyser | Web" + generic GPT description.
- **Recommendation:** Use a default title and description that include "Image to Prompt" and "image to prompt generator" so all pages (without their own metadata) support the main keyword. **Done in this repo:** root `layout.tsx` updated to use Image to Prompt–focused default metadata.

### Primary pages (already strong)
- `/` and `/image-to-prompt-converter`: "Free Image to Prompt Converter Online (AI Tool)" is good. Keep "image to prompt converter" and "image to prompt generator" in title/description/keywords.
- Add **"image to prompt generator"** (1.8K) explicitly in meta keywords and in H1/subheads where natural.

### Canonical & URLs
- Main tool URL: keep `/image-to-prompt-converter` or use `/` as canonical for "image to prompt" so you don’t split strength. Current canonicals look consistent.

## 2. Content Ideas From Ahrefs

### Target in existing content / new sections
| Keyword / Topic              | Vol  | Action |
|-----------------------------|------|--------|
| image to prompt generator   | 1.8K | Add to H2s, guide, and FAQs (e.g. "Free image to prompt generator"). |
| image to prompt ai          | 450  | Use in one subhead or FAQ: "Image to prompt AI" or "AI image to prompt tool". |
| prompt to image ai          | 400  | Optional FAQ: "What’s the difference between image to prompt and prompt to image?" (you do image→prompt; others do prompt→image). |

### Question-style content (FAQs / blog)
- **how to generate ai image from text prompt** (250)  
  → FAQ: e.g. "How do I use the generated prompt to create AI images?" (link to ChatGPT, Midjourney, etc.).
- **how to generate image from text prompt ai** (200)  
  → Same angle: "How do I turn my prompt into an AI image?" with short steps (copy prompt → paste in DALL·E/Midjourney/etc.).
- **how to create ai generated image from text prompt** (150)  
  → Same theme; one FAQ can cover all three.

Add these to `/faqs` and to the homepage FAQ block so they appear in results for question queries.

### "Also rank for" (supporting content)
- **prompt generator** (9.1K), **art prompt generator** (6.5K), **writing prompt generator** (9.0K)  
  → Add a short section or FAQ: "Is this an art prompt generator?" / "Is this a writing prompt generator?" and clarify: "We’re an **image to prompt** generator: you give an image, we give a prompt. You can then use that prompt in any prompt-to-image or writing tool."

## 4. International / Geography

- **India (23K), Bangladesh (9.2K), Indonesia (7.2K), US (5.4K), Egypt (5K), Pakistan (3.3K).**
- Ensure meta description and key paragraphs are clear for non‑native English (short sentences, "upload image → get prompt → use in ChatGPT/Midjourney").
- No need to localize immediately; one strong English page can still rank in these regions.
